			HISTORY
		</p>

		<p id="msg">
			The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
		</p>
		<p id="msg">
			It's a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
		</p>
		<p id="msg">
			One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

			CONCEPT
		</p>
		<p id="msg">
			The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. 
		</p>
		<p id="msg">
			Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each generations (step in time), some following rules are applied...

		<p id="title">
			RULES
		</p>
		<p id="msg">
			-Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.<br>
			-Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.<br>
			-Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.<br>
			-Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.<br>
			(This rule is called "B3/S23" for 3 -> Born, 2 or 3 -> Survive, some variante existe...)

			A still life is a pattern that does not change from one generation to the next.<br>
			You can see here four notables statics patterns, but they are rapidly altered by a glider...<br>
			Finally three statics patterns take place in new stable configuration.

			An oscillator is a pattern that repeats itself, after a fixed number<br>
